Material from Sickle Cell Community Outreach, Rikkos-Jos, Nigeria

GHMC Ltd. supported Maidunama Sickle Cell Foundation (MAISCEF) in the conduct of a Sickle Cell Outreach in Rikkos Community, Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria.

In the course of the outreach, we witnessed an unusually high turn-out of sickle cell anaemia sufferers, most of whom were from within the community and nearby areas. 

The initial data analysis was conducted with SPSS, but since we encountered R Statistical Programming Language, it was thought that the analysis should be reproduced in code and archived. Hence the creation of this repository.

DISCLAIMER: The data that was collected and analysed is from a convenience sample taken from routine forms administered by the Foundation during such events. The form that was administered was not designed by GHMC Ltd.
